*Staging & test site for [https://kbnldataservices.github.io/public-docs](https://kbnldataservices.github.io/public-docs)* 

You can use this site to test and preview the contributions (typically .md files) you made on the the ```gh-pages``` branch of the staging repo at [https://github.com/KBNLdataservices/public-docs-staging](https://github.com/KBNLdataservices/public-docs-staging/tree/gh-pages).

Once you have tested & previewed your contributions and you think they are OK for production, you can submit them (via a pull request with a dedicated branch) to the production repo at [https://github.com/KBNLdataservices/public-docs](https://github.com/KBNLdataservices/public-docs/tree/gh-pages). 

Once your submission has been approved by the admins of the production repo, you will see them in the  production site at [https://kbnldataservices.github.io/public-docs](https://kbnldataservices.github.io/public-docs).


## Related subsite and repo - blog & general pages
The [public-docs](https://kbnldataservices.github.io/public-docs) subsite - and its related [public-docs-staging](https://kbnldataservices.github.io/public-docs-staging/) subsite you are currently on - are part of the wider [KB Dataservices Github account](https://github.com/KBNLdataservices). 

Besides this documentation subsite, there is also the [kbnldataservices.github.io](https://kbnldataservices.github.io/kbnldataservices.github.io) subsite, which is served from the ```gh-pages``` branch of the  [https://kbnldataservices.github.io](https://github.com/KBNLdataservices/kbnldataservices.github.io/tree/gh-pages) repo. This subsite and repo hold the following two groups of pages: 

**1) Blog - news and updates**
* Blog home / latest articles: [https://kbnldataservices.github.io/blog](https://kbnldataservices.github.io/blog), redirected from [https://kbnldataservices.github.io](https://kbnldataservices.github.io), corresponding to [this file](https://github.com/KBNLdataservices/kbnldataservices.github.io/blob/gh-pages/_pages/index.md) in the repo
* Blog posts: https://kbnldataservices.github.io/blog/posts/some-post-title, corresponding to [this folder](https://github.com/KBNLdataservices/kbnldataservices.github.io/tree/gh-pages/_posts) in the repo 
* Blog posts groupings: 
  * Pinned articles: [https://kbnldataservices.github.io/blog/pinned](https://kbnldataservices.github.io/blog/pinned/), corresponding to [this folder](https://github.com/KBNLdataservices/kbnldataservices.github.io/tree/gh-pages/_pinned) and [this file](https://github.com/KBNLdataservices/kbnldataservices.github.io/blob/gh-pages/_pages/pinned.md) in the repo
